# My CSS – CSS Style Guide

This is a style guide describing how I try to write my css. This represents my view of CSS's [Platonic ideal]. It's a reference for myself and folks I manage or precede to facilitate consistency in codebases managed by more than one person.

This is a <i>differential style guide</i>, which is a term I made up just now to mean that I'm gonna link one or more guides (see [Guides]) that already describe a good bit of what I think, so I can just note where my style differs from those guides.

## Guides

This section links and briefly describes the style guide or guides that this guide "inherits from".

### [Code Guide] by [@mdo]
The basis for this style guide is the [CSS section of Mark Otto's Code Guide][Code Guide §CSS]. He's really smart about CSS and all kinds of things, and is worth following [on Twitter][@mdo on Twitter], if you don't already.


## Exceptions

This section covers areas where my style is different to the [Guides].

### Indentation
I use tabs for indentation.  The reason is that I believe in coder comfort.  Most major code editors allow configuring the tab character width.  If you like, two, you can set yours to two.  If wanna see four, you can set it to four.


## Additions

This section covers areas not covered by the [Guides] that I think are important enough to mention here.
